                <p>
                    I'm a native Houstonian. In 2018 I graduated 
                    from Texas A&M with a major in Industrial Engineering and a 
                    minor in Mathematics. During my degree program I was introduced
                    to C++. This was my first experience with computer programming 
                    and I really developed a liking to it. After graduating, I was
                    hired by Halliburton Energy services to be a field engineer for 
                    their their <abbr title="Production Enhancement (fancy word for
                    hydraulic fracturing)">PE</abbr> 
                    product service line in Midland, TX. I learned quite a bit and met some really great people 
                    throughout the year and a half I spent in this role. I was able to ride out mutliple waves of 
                    layoffs during this time, but unfortunately I got my call in late april of 2020. I view this as
                    a blessing in disguise because I not only was able to move back home, but it also gives me a 
                    chance to pursue my passion for programming.
